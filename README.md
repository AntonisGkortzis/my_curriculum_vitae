About the online CV
===================

It is a work replicated from this [link](https://github.com/mszep/pandoc_resume), but modified to my own needs.
In adddion, it automates the build process by creating a new branch on travis and backing it back the Github repository after a success compilation.
To set-up auto-push for travis consider reading the tutorial found [here](https://aueb-balab.github.io/courses/tools/travis_ci-p.html#/27) (Section: Auto-deploying gh-pages with Travis (Linux distros)). 
Feel free to modify it or extend it.
