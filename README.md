About the online CV
===================

It is a work replicated from this [link](https://github.com/mszep/pandoc_resume), but modified to my own needs.
In adddion, it automates the build process by creating a new branch on travis and backing it back the Github repository after a success compilation.
To set-up auto-push from Travis (creates a new branch) consider reading this [tutorial](https://aueb-balab.github.io/courses/tools/travis_ci_cv_template-p.html#/) (Section: Auto-deploying gh-pages with Travis (Linux distros)).
